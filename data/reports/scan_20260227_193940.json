This rating is due to the presence of several high-severity vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers, but the absence of critical severity issues prevents a lower rating.\n\n### KEY FINDINGS\nThe security scan revealed several key findings, including **missing security headers** such as X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy, as well as a **potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability**. These issues can be exploited by attackers to launch targeted attacks.\n\n### BUSINESS RISK\nThe identified vulnerabilities pose a significant business risk, as they could be used to compromise user data, launch phishing attacks, or deface the website. This could lead to reputational damage and financial losses.\n\n### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED\nTo address the high-severity issues, the following actions are required:\n* Implement X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy security headers\n* Conduct a thorough review of the website's code to identify and fix the potential XSS vulnerability\n* Perform regular security scans to identify and address new vulnerabilities\n\n### RECOMMENDATIONS\nTo improve the overall security posture, it is recommended to implement a **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** and conduct **regular security awareness training** for developers.

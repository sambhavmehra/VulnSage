      "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\niommu: disable SVA when CONFIG_X86 is set\n\nPatch series \"Fix stale IOTLB entries for kernel address space\", v7.\n\nThis proposes a fix for a security vulnerability related to IOMMU Shared\nVirtual Addressing (SVA).  In an SVA context, an IOMMU can cache kernel\npage table entries.  When a kernel page table page is freed and\nreallocated for another purpose, the IOMMU might still hold stale,\nincorrect entries.  This can be exploited to cause a use-after-free or\nwrite-after-free condition, potentially leading to privilege escalation or\ndata corruption.\n\nThis solution introduces a deferred freeing mechanism for kernel page\ntable pages, which provides a safe window to notify the IOMMU to\ninvalidate its caches before the page is reused.\n\n\nThis patch (of 8):\n\nIn the IOMMU Shared Virtual Addressing (SVA) context, the IOMMU hardware\nshares and walks the CPU's page tables.  The x86 architecture maps the\nkernel's virtual address space into the upper portion of every process's\npage table.  Consequently, in an SVA context, the IOMMU hardware can walk\nand cache kernel page table entries.\n\nThe Linux kernel currently lacks a notification mechanism for kernel page\ntable changes, specifically when page table pages are freed and reused. \nThe IOMMU driver is only notified of changes to user virtual address\nmappings.  This can cause the IOMMU's internal caches to retain stale\nentries for kernel VA.\n\nUse-After-Free (UAF) and Write-After-Free (WAF) conditions arise when\nkernel page table pages are freed and later reallocated.  The IOMMU could\nmisinterpret the new data as valid page table entries.  The IOMMU might\nthen walk into attacker-controlled memory, leading to arbitrary physical\nmemory DMA access or privilege escalation.  This is also a\nWrite-After-Free issue, as the IOMMU will potentially continue to write\nAccessed and Dirty bits to the freed memory while attempting to walk the\nstale page tables.\n\nCurrently, SVA contexts are unprivileged and cannot access kernel\nmappings.  However, the IOMMU will still walk kernel-only page tables all\nthe way down to the leaf entries, where it realizes the mapping is for the\nkernel and errors out.  This means the IOMMU still caches these\nintermediate page table entries, making the described vulnerability a real\nconcern.\n\nDisable SVA on x86 architecture until the IOMMU can receive notification\nto flush the paging cache before freeing the CPU kernel page table pages.",

      "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\npowerpc/64s/slb: Fix SLB multihit issue during SLB preload\n\nOn systems using the hash MMU, there is a software SLB preload cache that\nmirrors the entries loaded into the hardware SLB buffer. This preload\ncache is subject to periodic eviction \u2014 typically after every 256 context\nswitches \u2014 to remove old entry.\n\nTo optimize performance, the kernel skips switch_mmu_context() in\nswitch_mm_irqs_off() when the prev and next mm_struct are the same.\nHowever, on hash MMU systems, this can lead to inconsistencies between\nthe hardware SLB and the software preload cache.\n\nIf an SLB entry for a process is evicted from the software cache on one\nCPU, and the same process later runs on another CPU without executing\nswitch_mmu_context(), the hardware SLB may retain stale entries. If the\nkernel then attempts to reload that entry, it can trigger an SLB\nmulti-hit error.\n\nThe following timeline shows how stale SLB entries are created and can\ncause a multi-hit error when a process moves between CPUs without a\nMMU context switch.\n\nCPU 0                                   CPU 1\n-----                                    -----\nProcess P\nexec                                    swapper/1\n load_elf_binary\n  begin_new_exc\n    activate_mm\n     switch_mm_irqs_off\n      switch_mmu_context\n       switch_slb\n       /*\n        * This invalidates all\n        * the entries in the HW\n        * and setup the new HW\n        * SLB entries as per the\n        * preload cache.\n        */\ncontext_switch\nsched_migrate_task migrates process P to cpu-1\n\nProcess swapper/0                       context switch (to process P)\n(uses mm_struct of Process P)           switch_mm_irqs_off()\n                                         switch_slb\n                                           load_slb++\n                                            /*\n                                            * load_slb becomes 0 here\n                                            * and we evict an entry from\n                                            * the preload cache with\n                                            * preload_age().

During mount,\nget_tree_bdev_flags() calls sb_set_blocksize(sb, block_size(bdev)),\nbut since block_size(bdev) > PAGE_SIZE, sb_set_blocksize() leaves\nsb->s_blocksize at zero.\n\nLater, ntfs_init_from_boot() attempts to read the boot_block while\nsb->s_blocksize is still zero, which triggers the bug.\n\n[almaz.alexandrovich@paragon-software.com: changed comment style, added\nreturn value handling]",

      "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nublk: fix deadlock when reading partition table\n\nWhen one process(such as udev) opens ublk block device (e.g., to read\nthe partition table via bdev_open()), a deadlock[1] can occur:\n\n1. bdev_open() grabs disk->open_mutex\n2. The process issues read I/O to ublk backend to read partition table\n3. In __ublk_complete_rq(), blk_update_request() or blk_mq_end_request()\n   runs bio->bi_end_io() callbacks\n4. If this triggers fput() on file descriptor of ublk block device, the\n   work may be deferred to current task's task work (see fput() implementation)\n5. This eventually calls blkdev_release() from the same context\n6. blkdev_release() tries to grab disk->open_mutex again\n7. Deadlock: same task waiting for a mutex it already holds\n\nThe fix is to run blk_update_request() and blk_mq_end_request() with bottom\nhalves disabled. This forces blkdev_release() to run in kernel work-queue\ncontext instead of current task work context, and allows ublk server to make\nforward progress, and avoids the deadlock.\n\n[axboe: rewrite comment in ublk]",

During device detachment, the original implementation\ncalls flush_workqueue() in psmouse_disconnect() to ensure\ncompletion of dev3_register_work.

Avoid\ntaking a referencing when the neighbour is used by a nexthop as the\nneighbour entry associated with the nexthop already holds a reference.\n\nTested by running the test that uncovered the problem over 300 times.\nWithout this patch the problem was reproduced after a handful of\niterations.\n\n[1]\nBUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in mlxsw_sp_neigh_entry_update+0x2d4/0x310\nRead of size 8 at addr ffff88817f8e3420 by task ip/3929\n\nCPU: 3 UID: 0 PID: 3929 Comm: ip Not tainted 6.18.0-rc4-virtme-g36b21a067510 #3 PREEMPT(full)\nHardware name: Nvidia SN5600/VMOD0013, BIOS 5.13 05/31/2023\nCall Trace:\n <TASK>\n dump_stack_lvl+0x6f/0xa0\n print_address_description.constprop.0+0x6e/0x300\n print_report+0xfc/0x1fb\n kasan_report+0xe4/0x110\n mlxsw_sp_neigh_entry_update+0x2d4/0x310\n mlxsw_sp_router_rif_gone_sync+0x35f/0x510\n mlxsw_sp_rif_destroy+0x1ea/0x730\n mlxsw_sp_inetaddr_port_vlan_event+0xa1/0x1b0\n __mlxsw_sp_inetaddr_lag_event+0xcc/0x130\n __mlxsw_sp_inetaddr_event+0xf5/0x3c0\n mlxsw_sp_router_netdevice_event+0x1015/0x1580\n notifier_call_chain+0xcc/0x150\n call_netdevice_notifiers_info+0x7e/0x100\n __netdev_upper_dev_unlink+0x10b/0x210\n netdev_upper_dev_unlink+0x79/0xa0\n vrf_del_slave+0x18/0x50\n do_set_master+0x146/0x7d0\n do_setlink.isra.0+0x9a0/0x2880\n rtnl_newlink+0x637/0xb20\n rtnetlink_rcv_msg+0x6fe/0xb90\n netlink_rcv_skb+0x123/0x380\n netlink_unicast+0x4a3/0x770\n netlink_sendmsg+0x75b/0xc90\n __sock_sendmsg+0xbe/0x160\n ____sys_sendmsg+0x5b2/0x7d0\n ___sys_sendmsg+0xfd/0x180\n __sys_sendmsg+0x124/0x1c0\n do_syscall_64+0xbb/0xfd0\n entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x4b/0x53\n[...]\n\nAllocated by task 109:\n kasan_save_stack+0x30/0x50\n kasan_save_track+0x14/0x30\n __kasan_kmalloc+0x7b/0x90\n __kmalloc_noprof+0x2c1/0x790\n neigh_alloc+0x6af/0x8f0\n ___neigh_create+0x63/0xe90\n mlxsw_sp_nexthop_neigh_init+0x430/0x7e0\n mlxsw_sp_nexthop_type_init+0x212/0x960\n mlxsw_sp_nexthop6_group_info_init.constprop.0+0x81f/0x1280\n mlxsw_sp_nexthop6_group_get+0x392/0x6a0\n mlxsw_sp_fib6_entry_create+0x46a/0xfd0\n mlxsw_sp_router_fib6_replace+0x1ed/0x5f0\n mlxsw_sp_router_fib6_event_work+0x10a/0x2a0\n process_one_work+0xd57/0x1390\n worker_thread+0x4d6/0xd40\n kthread+0x355/0x5b0\n ret_from_fork+0x1d4/0x270\n ret_from_fork_asm+0x11/0x20\n\nFreed by task 154:\n kasan_save_stack+0x30/0x50\n kasan_save_track+0x14/0x30\n __kasan_save_free_info+0x3b/0x60\n __kasan_slab_free+0x43/0x70\n kmem_cache_free_bulk.part.0+0x1eb/0x5e0\n kvfree_rcu_bulk+0x1f2/0x260\n kfree_rcu_work+0x130/0x1b0\n process_one_work+0xd57/0x1390\n worker_thread+0x4d6/0xd40\n kthread+0x355/0x5b0\n ret_from_fork+0x1d4/0x270\n ret_from_fork_asm+0x11/0x20\n\nLast potentially related work creation:\n kasan_save_stack+0x30/0x50\n kasan_record_aux_stack+0x8c/0xa0\n kvfree_call_rcu+0x93/0x5b0\n mlxsw_sp_router_neigh_event_work+0x67d/0x860\n process_one_work+0xd57/0x1390\n worker_thread+0x4d6/0xd40\n kthread+0x355/0x5b0\n ret_from_fork+0x1d4/0x270\n ret_from_fork_asm+0x11/0x20",

When detected in ethtool_get_strings():\n    # ethtool -S eth2\n    no stats available\n\n2. When detected in get stats, all stats will be reported as zero.\n\nBoth cases are presumably transient, and a subsequent ethtool call\nshould succeed.\n\nOther than the overflow avoidance, these two cases are very evident (no\noutput/cleared stats), which is arguably better than presenting\nincorrect/shifted stats.\nI also considered returning an error instead of a \"silent\" response, but\nthat seems more destructive towards userspace apps.\n\nNotes:\n- This patch does not claim to fix the inherent race, it only makes sure\n  that we do not overflow the userspace buffer, and makes for a more\n  predictable behavior.\n\n- RTNL lock is held during each ioctl, the race window exists between\n  the separate ioctl calls when the lock is released.\n\n- Userspace ethtool always fills stats.n_stats, but it is likely that\n  these stats ioctls are implemented in other userspace applications\n  which might not fill it. The added code checks that it's not zero,\n  to prevent any regressions.",

When this occurs while a CPU is\nconnected to the default root domain the flag may retain the bad\nstate after the CPU has been unplugged. Later, a different CPU\nthat is transitioning through the default root domain may push a\ndeadline task to the powered down CPU when cpudl_find sees its\nfree_cpus bit is set. If this happens the task will not have the\nopportunity to run.\n\nOne example is outlined here:\nhttps://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20250110233010.2339521-1-opendmb@gmail.com\n\nAnother occurs when the last deadline task is migrated from a\nCPU that has an offlined runqueue. The dequeue_task member of\nthe deadline scheduler class will eventually call cpudl_clear\nand set the free_cpus bit for the CPU.\n\nThis commit modifies the cpudl_clear function to be aware of the\nonline state of the deadline runqueue so that the free_cpus mask\ncan be updated appropriately.\n\nIt is no longer necessary to manage the mask outside of the\ncpudl_set/clear functions so the cpudl_set/clear_freecpu\nfunctions are removed. In addition, since the free_cpus mask is\nnow only updated under the cpudl lock the code was changed to\nuse the non-atomic __cpumask functions.",

      "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: don't log conflicting inode if it's a dir moved in the current transaction\n\nWe can't log a conflicting inode if it's a directory and it was moved\nfrom one parent directory to another parent directory in the current\ntransaction, as this can result an attempt to have a directory with\ntwo hard links during log replay, one for the old parent directory and\nanother for the new parent directory.\n\nThe following scenario triggers that issue:\n\n1) We have directories \"dir1\" and \"dir2\" created in a past transaction.\n   Directory \"dir1\" has inode A as its parent directory;\n\n2) We move \"dir1\" to some other directory;\n\n3) We create a file with the name \"dir1\" in directory inode A;\n\n4) We fsync the new file. This results in logging the inode of the new file\n   and the inode for the directory \"dir1\" that was previously moved in the\n   current transaction. So the log tree has the INODE_REF item for the\n   new location of \"dir1\";\n\n5) We move the new file to some other directory. This results in updating\n   the log tree to included the new INODE_REF for the new location of the\n   file and removes the INODE_REF for the old location. This happens\n   during the rename when we call btrfs_log_new_name();\n\n6) We fsync the file, and that persists the log tree changes done in the\n   previous step (btrfs_log_new_name() only updates the log tree in\n   memory);\n\n7) We have a power failure;\n\n8) Next time the fs is mounted, log replay happens and when processing\n   the inode for directory \"dir1\" we find a new INODE_REF and add that\n   link, but we don't remove the old link of the inode since we have\n   not logged the old parent directory of the directory inode \"dir1\".\n\nAs a result after log replay finishes when we trigger writeback of the\nsubvolume tree's extent buffers, the tree check will detect that we have\na directory a hard link count of 2 and we get a mount failure.\nThe errors and stack traces reported in dmesg/syslog are like this:\n\n   [ 3845.729764] BTRFS info (device dm-0): start tree-log replay\n   [ 3845.730304] page: refcount:3 mapcount:0 mapping:000000005c8a3027 index:0x1d00 pfn:0x11510c\n   [ 3845.731236] memcg:ffff9264c02f4e00\n   [ 3845.731751] aops:btree_aops [btrfs] ino:1\n   [ 3845.732300] flags: 0x17fffc00000400a(uptodate|private|writeback|node=0|zone=2|lastcpupid=0x1ffff)\n   [ 3845.733346] raw: 017fffc00000400a 0000000000000000 dead000000000122 ffff9264d978aea8\n   [ 3845.734265] raw: 0000000000001d00 ffff92650e6d4738 00000003ffffffff ffff9264c02f4e00\n   [ 3845.735305] page dumped because: eb page dump\n   [ 3845.735981] BTRFS critical (device dm-0): corrupt leaf: root=5 block=30408704 slot=6 ino=257, invalid nlink: has 2 expect no more than 1 for dir\n   [ 3845.737786] BTRFS info (device dm-0): leaf 30408704 gen 10 total ptrs 17 free space 14881 owner 5\n   [ 3845.737789] BTRFS info (device dm-0): refs 4 lock_owner 0 current 30701\n   [ 3845.737792] \titem 0 key (256 INODE_ITEM 0) itemoff 16123 itemsize 160\n   [ 3845.737794] \t\tinode generation 3 transid 9 size 16 nbytes 16384\n   [ 3845.737795] \t\tblock group 0 mode 40755 links 1 uid 0 gid 0\n   [ 3845.737797] \t\trdev 0 sequence 2 flags 0x0\n   [ 3845.737798] \t\tatime 1764259517.0\n   [ 3845.737800] \t\tctime 1764259517.572889464\n   [ 3845.737801] \t\tmtime 1764259517.572889464\n   [ 3845.737802] \t\totime 1764259517.0\n   [ 3845.737803] \titem 1 key (256 INODE_REF 256) itemoff 16111 itemsize 12\n   [ 3845.737805] \t\tindex 0 name_len 2\n   [ 3845.737807] \titem 2 key (256 DIR_ITEM 2363071922) itemoff 16077 itemsize 34\n   [ 3845.737808] \t\tlocation key (257 1 0) type 2\n   [ 3845.737810] \t\ttransid 9 data_len 0 name_len 4\n   [ 3845.737811] \titem 3 key (256 DIR_ITEM 2676584006) itemoff 16043 itemsize 34\n   [ 3845.737813] \t\tlocation key (258 1 0) type 2\n   [ 3845.737814] \t\ttransid 9 data_len 0 name_len 4\n   [ 3845.737815] \titem 4 key (256 DIR_INDEX 2) itemoff 16009 itemsize 34\n   [ 3845.737816] \t\tlocation key (257 1 0) type 2\n   [\n---truncated---",

The stuck task was usually modprobe (often loading\na driver like ipvlan), trying to take the lock as a Writer.\nlockdep does not track readers for rwsems so the read wasn't obvious\nfrom the reports.\n\nOn closer inspection the Reader holding the lock was conntrack looping\nforever in nf_conntrack_cleanup_net_list(). Based on past experience\nwith occasional NIPA crashes I looked thru the tests which run before\nthe crash and noticed that the crash follows ip_defrag.sh. An immediate\nred flag. Scouring thru (de)fragmentation queues reveals skbs sitting\naround, holding conntrack references.\n\nThe problem is that since conntrack depends on nf_defrag_ipv6,\nnf_defrag_ipv6 will load first. Since nf_defrag_ipv6 loads first its\nnetns exit hooks run _after_ conntrack's netns exit hook.\n\nFlush all fragment queue SKBs during fqdir_pre_exit() to release\nconntrack references before conntrack cleanup runs. Also flush\nthe queues in timer expiry handlers when they discover fqdir->dead\nis set, in case packet sneaks in while we're running the pre_exit\nflush.\n\nThe commit under Fixes is not exactly the culprit, but I think\npreviously the timer firing would eventually unblock the spinning\nconntrack.",

      "description": "Emlog is an open source website building system. emlog v2.6.1 and earlier exposes a REST API endpoint (/index.php?rest-api=upload) for media file uploads. The endpoint fails to implement proper validation of file types, extensions, and content, allowing authenticated attackers (with a valid API key or admin session cookie) to upload arbitrary files (including malicious PHP scripts) to the server. An attacker can obtain the API key either by gaining administrator access to enable the REST API setting, or via information disclosure vulnerabilities in the application. Once uploaded, the malicious PHP file can be executed to gain remote code execution (RCE) on the target server, leading to full server compromise.",

      "description": "hermes is an implementation of the HERMES workflow to automatize software publication with rich metadata. From 0.8.1 to before 0.9.1, hermes subcommands take arbitrary options under the -O argument. These have been logged in raw form. If users provide sensitive data such as API tokens (e.g., via hermes deposit -O invenio_rdm.auth_token SECRET), these are written to the log file in plain text, making them available to whoever can access the log file. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.9.1.",
